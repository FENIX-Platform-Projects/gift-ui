    background_first_line: "Data on individual food consumption are needed to better inform agricultural and food policies andprogrammes at global, " +
    "national and sub-national level. Moreover, nutrition indicators expressed as nutrients needed to inform nutrition " +
    "sensitive agriculture and fortification policies. Nutrient food sources also need to be identified in order to " +
    "develop food based dietary guidelines. Currently, at global level, most policies and programmes are informed" +
    " by data related to the availability of food at national level (food supply data) or at household level (household survey data). " +
    "It is the case for the global food-based nutrition indicators which appear in the" +
    " SOFI publication (The State of Food Insecurity in the World) published annually by FAO and in " +
    "the Millennium Development Goals. Current global food-based nutrition indicators would be strengthened if " +
    "also gender sensitive data on individual food consumption were used.",

    background_second_line: "However, available individual food consumption data are extremely " +
    "under-utilized mainly because they are not made publicly available in an appropriate dissemination" +
    "platform and under a harmonised format that would allow assessing time and geographical trends.",

    background_third_line: "At FAO level, FAOSTAT is one of the ways the organization accomplishes its mission of improving data " +
    "collection and dissemination1. Through that online platform, users can freely and easily access data for 245" +
    "countries and35 regional areas from 1961 to the most recent year available. Enhanced features such as browse and" +
    " analysis of data and an advanced interactive data download are proposed by FAOSTAT. Available data include production," +
    " expenditure, supply, food security and many others but data on individual food consumption are still missing.",

    objective_title: "2. Objectives",

    objective_body: "FAO and WHO will work together to enrich FAOSTAT with a publicly available multipurpose global database " +
    "obtained through the collation and harmonization of existing data collected within individual food consumption surveys " +
    "conducted at national or sub-national level. This will contribute to increase the capacity of all stakeholders " +
    "to monitor food consumption.",
